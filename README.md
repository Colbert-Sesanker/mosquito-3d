Duke Mathematical Biology Workshop 2015: Modeling population dynamics of the malaria mosquito under a sex ratio distortion system

Theoretical evolutionary biologists have hypothesized that inducing a male biased reproductive sex ratio in mosquitoes may be an effective way of controlling mosquito populations. By introducing transgenic male mosquitoes that produce predominantly male offspring into the wild mosquito population, one can effectively distort the mosquito reproductive sex ratio such that there will be fewer females in subsequent generations to reproduce, hence resulting in the eradication of the mosquito population. Since the malaria parasite is transmitted only by pregnant female mosquitoes, it is possible to reduce the incidence of malaria by reducing the population of female mosquitoes. 

A proof of concept is shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/YEhoblpiARU). Parameters for the mosquito life cycle were implemented according to documented data for the malaria mosquito _Anopheles gambiae_. Note that there are two types of male mosquitoes present : one that is normal (produce male and female offspring in a 1:1 ratio) and one that is transgenic (produce male and female offspring in a 19:1 ratio). 

This project was put together at the 2015 Duke Mathematical Biology workshop in collaboration with Jackie Hudepohl from Carnegie Mellon University and with guidance from Colbert Sesanker, PhD candidate at Duke University. Motivation for this project came from a publication by Galizi et al.(2014).
